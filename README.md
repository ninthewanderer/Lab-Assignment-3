    This lab was for DIG4714 (Intermediate Game Development) <br> and it was a practice in solving mathematical word problems <br> within Unity using the Inspector. <br><br>
    In this assignment, Unity was used as a calculator using Debug.Log, <br> the Start() method, and Play Mode. <br><br>

  <h2 align="center">Task 1</h2> 
  <p align="center"> 
  This was the first task, which was completed by Lauren Holloway in <a href="https://github.com/ninthewanderer/Lab-Assignment-3/blob/main/Task1.cs">Task1.cs</a>:
    <br><br>
    <table align="center">
      <td align="center">
      <i>You are supposed to be paid $X dollars. <br> How many bills of hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, or one will you get? <br> For example, if you are to be paid $47, you will get 2 x $20 bills, 1 x $5 bill, and 2 x $1 bills. <br>
      I want to enter an X value, and the program should produce a meaningful output <br> that gives me how that amount should be paid in bills. <br> Assume/control that the amount will not have decimals — so, no change coins.</i>
      </td>
    </table>
    <br>
      <p align="center"> 
      The main issue we faced with this task is that the logic within the for loop <br> and the values within the array are correct, but the output string is incorrect.
    <br><br>
  </p>

  <h2 align="center">Task 2</h2> 
  <p align="center"> 
  Task 2, which I worked on, was completed in <a href="https://github.com/ninthewanderer/Lab-Assignment-3/blob/main/Task2.cs">Task2.cs</a>:
    <br><br>
    <table align="center">
      <td align="center">
      <i>Suppose that the cover price of a book is $X, but the bookstores get a 40% discount. <br> Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and ¢75 for each additional copy. <br>
        Calculate the total wholescale cost and profit (before operational costs) when the bookstore sells Y copies of a book. <br> I want to enter the X and Y values and get the cost and the profit as a meaningful output.</i>
      </td>
    </table>
    <br>
      <p align="center"> 
      This task was completed without issue, but I did have some concern about whether the user <br> would know to enter a float for the discount number or if they'd enter an integer. <br>
      In the end, the professor gave me the okay to hard-code the value at 40%.
